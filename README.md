# Fibonacci number
Write a method that returns the nth element of the Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Assume that indexes start at zero, e.g., fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, ...

# Even Fibonacci Sum

Write a method that returns the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers. Consider all Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to n.
Each new element in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two elements.

The first few terms of Fibonacci Numbers are, 1, 1, **2**, 3, 5, **8**, 13, 21, **34**, 55, 89, **144**, 233 ,â€¦ (Even numbers are highlighted).

Input : limit = 8
Output : 10
Explanation : 2 + 8 = 10

Input : limit = 400;
Output : 188.
Explanation : 2 + 8 + 34 + 144 = 188.
